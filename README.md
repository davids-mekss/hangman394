# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

##TODO: what it does, the aim of the project, and what you learned

The aim of this project is to put the Python skills I have learnt so far in a practical real life application. 

The Hangman project will allow me to test my skills in implementing functions, loops, classes, methods, code documentation, object oriented programming principles and so much more. 

>Also, it will provide a fun game to play while watching AiCore learning material. =`)`
