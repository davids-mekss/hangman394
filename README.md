# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Project Aim

The aim of this project is to apply the Python skills I have learnt so far in a practical real life application. A successful Hangman game needs to randomly generate a word, ask for user input, check that the input is valid and check if the input is part of the word which user is trying to guess.

The Hangman project will allow me to test my skills in different areas of coding such as implementing functions, loops, classes, methods, code documentation, object oriented programming principles and more. 

>Also, it will provide a fun game to play while watching AiCore learning material. =`)`

## Installation
Simply download the public GitHub repo and open the file in any editor that supports Python with an output - this could be your terminal or Visual Studio code.

## Usage

>To start the game, simply run hangman_Template.py

Upon starting the game, the computer is going to randomly pick a word from a pre-existing word list. You will then be asked to guess a letter. If it is part of the word, you will see the word you are trying to guess update. Unknown letters will be marked with an underscore.

You start the game with 5 lives, each incorrect guess loses you one.
To win the game, guess the word before running out of lives!

## File Structure
As this was part of my learning journey, the project consists of multiple milestones. If you are interested to see how the game was developed gradually, you can view the other files. But really, to play the game, you only need hangman_Template.py

## Licence
There is no licence
